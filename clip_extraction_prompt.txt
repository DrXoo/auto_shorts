# TASK: Extract Viral-Worthy Clips from Gaming Podcast

## CONTEXT
You are analyzing a Spanish gaming podcast transcript to identify the best segments for creating viral short-form videos (TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts).

**Podcast Details:**
- Language: Spanish
- Format: 3 people discussing videogames (can be more depending on the topic, when having guests)
- Speakers: each speaker will have a name like SPEAKER_01, SPEAKER_02, SPEAKER_00 (and possibly others)

**Episode Topic:**
REMEMBER WRITE THE TOPIC

## INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. IDENTIFY VIRAL-WORTHY SEGMENTS (30-90 seconds)

Look for segments that have:

**CONTENT QUALITY:**
- **Emotional moments:** Excitement, surprise, laughter, strong reactions
- **Hot takes:** Controversial or unexpected opinions
- **Debates:** Arguments or disagreements between hosts
- **Storytelling:** Funny anecdotes or gaming experiences
- **Tips/Insights:** Valuable advice or little-known facts
- **Predictions:** Bold predictions about gaming industry
- **Strong opinions:** Hot takes about popular games
- **Breaking news:** Recent announcements or industry news
- **Controversy:** Debate about games or industry topics

**TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Duration: 30-90 seconds (ideal: 45-60 seconds)
- Self-contained: Can be understood without prior context
- Clear speakers: Not too many people talking at once
- Good pacing: Engaging throughout, not slow or monotonous
- **Natural boundaries:** Find natural conversation breaks - don't cut mid-sentence or mid-word
- **Complete thoughts:** Clip should start and end at logical points in the conversation

### 2. AVOID
- Long explanations that lose energy
- Technical jargon without context
- Inside jokes that need background
- Slow-paced discussions
- Cutting mid-sentence or mid-thought
- Abrupt starts or endings

### 3. INPUT FORMAT 

The transcript is provided in this format:

```
[segment_start_second - segment_end_second] speaker_name: sentence
```

Example:
```
[150.5 - 153.2] SPEAKER_01: Eso es increíble!
[153.5 - 158.8] SPEAKER_02: Sí, pero el problema es que...
```

### 4. OUTPUT FORMAT

Provide a JSON array with ALL clips. Each clip must include:

```json
[
  {
    "clip_number": 1,
    "start_time": 150.5,
    "end_time": 195.0,
    "duration_seconds": 44.5,
    "speakers": ["SPEAKER_01", "SPEAKER_02"],
    "title": "Catchy title for the clip",
    "description": "Brief description of what happens",
    "viral_potential": "HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW",
    "why_viral": "Why this will perform well as a short video",
    "hook": "First 3 seconds that grab attention"
  },
  {
    "clip_number": 2,
    "start_time": 345.0,
    "end_time": 390.0,
    "duration_seconds": 45.0,
    "speakers": ["SPEAKER_00", "SPEAKER_01", "SPEAKER_02"],
    "title": "Another clip title",
    "description": "What happens in this clip",
    "viral_potential": "MEDIUM",
    "why_viral": "Explains viral potential",
    "hook": "Opening hook description"
  }
]
```

**IMPORTANT TIME RULES:**
- Use seconds as numbers (floats), exactly as they appear in the transcript
- `start_time` = the FIRST segment_start_second in the clip (e.g., 150.5)
- `end_time` = the LAST segment_end_second in the clip (e.g., 195.0)
- `duration_seconds` = end_time - start_time
- Keep decimal precision from the transcript timestamps

**SPEAKERS FIELD:**
- List all unique speakers who talk in this clip
- Use exact speaker names from transcript (e.g., ["SPEAKER_01", "SPEAKER_02"])
- Order doesn't matter

### 5. PRIORITIZATION

Rank clips by:
1. Emotional impact / entertainment value
2. Shareability (will people send this to friends?)
3. Platform fit (works well in vertical video format)
4. Virality potential (stops scrollers, generates engagement)

## EXAMPLE

**Input transcript fragment:**
```
[150.5s - 153.2s] SPEAKER_01: ¡No puedo creer que hayan hecho eso!
[153.5s - 156.8s] SPEAKER_02: Es la peor decisión que han tomado.
[157.0s - 162.5s] SPEAKER_01: Literal, van a perder millones de jugadores.
[163.0s - 168.2s] SPEAKER_03: Bueno, pero hay que ver el lado positivo...
[168.5s - 174.8s] SPEAKER_02: ¿Qué lado positivo? Esto es un desastre total.
```

**Output:**
```json
[
  {
    "clip_number": 1,
    "start_time": 150.5,
    "end_time": 174.8,
    "duration_seconds": 24.3,
    "speakers": ["SPEAKER_01", "SPEAKER_02", "SPEAKER_03"],
    "title": "La PEOR Decisión de la Historia",
    "description": "Los hosts reaccionan con incredulidad a una decisión polémica",
    "viral_potential": "HIGH",
    "why_viral": "Strong emotional reactions, controversial opinion, relatable frustration",
    "hook": "¡No puedo creer que hayan hecho eso! - immediate shock value"
  }
]
```
