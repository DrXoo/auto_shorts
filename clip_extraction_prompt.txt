### 2. AVOID
- Long explanations that lose energy
- Technical jargon without context
- Inside jokes that need background
- Slow-paced discussions

### 3. INPUT FORMAT 

[segment_start_second - segment_end_second] speaker_name: sentence

### 3. OUTPUT FORMAT

For each clip you identify, provide:

```json
{
  "clip_number": 1,
  "start_time": "MM:SS", 
  "end_time": "MM:SS",
  "duration_seconds": 45,
  "title": "Catchy title for the clip",
  "description": "Brief description of what happens",
  "trending_topic": "Which trending topic it relates to (if any)",
  "viral_potential": "HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW",
  "why_viral": "Why this will perform well as a short video",
  "hook": "First 3 seconds that grab attention",
}
```
start_time = the first segment_start_second 
end_time = the last segment_end_second

### 4. PRIORITIZATION

Rank clips by:
1. Relevance to trending topics (highest weight)
2. Emotional impact / entertainment value
3. Shareability (will people send this to friends?)
4. Platform fit (works well in vertical video format)

1. Analyze the FULL transcript (provided separately)
2. Identify 5-20 best clips for short-form videos
3. Prioritize clips about trending topics
4. Provide detailed JSON output for each clip
5. Rank them by viral potential

Focus on creating clips that will:
- Stop scrollers in their tracks
- Generate comments and shares
